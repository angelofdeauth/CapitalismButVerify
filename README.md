CBV is a blockchain-based real-world proof-of-work analysis tool. Its main design goal is to standardize human work as a unit which accurately reflects the neurological impact of the human having performed that work. CBV stores work records as multiple time series, each reflecting a recording of various regions of the brain responsible for different actions. This work record is cryptographically verifiable, auditable, and can be analyzed to return a unit which accurately reflects mental and physical work standardized across all humans.
